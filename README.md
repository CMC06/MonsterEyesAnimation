# Monster Eyes Animation
## Project Description
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>
This is an animation project that uses Javascript to track mouse movement and make eyeballs appear to track the mouse locations as the mouse moves around the screen.

## How to Run
This project runs in the browser, it currently requires a mouse to work correctly.

## Future Improvements
<li>Add styling to create a monster face for the eyes</li>
<li>Add additional monster faces that can be swapped</li>
<li>Create "lights out" button and "lights on" button that makes the screen go dark (lights off) and then back to new monster with normal lighting (lights on)</li>
<li>Add mobile friend event listeners so that the project will load correctly on mobile browser</li>
